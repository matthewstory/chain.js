chain.js -- a super-duper stripped down library providing method chaining
            capabilities similar to jquery ... and callbacks.

How To Use the Chain class:

Chain is a class, it uses it's prototype object to establish a base of
inheritence.  To invoke a new chain:

    new Chain()

Should you want to extend your chain to do something worthwhile, you
can do so in a variety of ways:

    function MyChain() {
        Chain.prototype.__init__.apply(this, arguments);
        this.constructor = MyChain;
    }

    MyChain.prototype['foo'] = function() {
        alert('I did something!');
    }
